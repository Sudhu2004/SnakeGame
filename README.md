HI Guys

In the upcoming files I will be going to show you how the snake game can be done with the following steps :

1.Create a snake body.

2.Move the snake.

3.Control the snake.

4.Detech collision with food.

5.Create a score board.

6.detect collision with wall.

7.detect collision with tail.


In the program I will be using the objects of "Turtle" module 
Make sure you have installed turtle on your system

editor = vscode
python version - python 3.11.1
